		<h4> Biography </h4>

		<p> <b> Bailey believes fervently in the power of language to change the world. </b>An english major at Columbia University, she came to a stark realization after graduation that career opportunities for english majors were few and far between.</p>


		<p> Undiscouraged by dismal odds, Bailey found her way giving voice to organizations and brands on digital media. With a knack for distilling complex issues into <b> sharp calls-to-action </b>, Bailey has crafted messaging that provoked policy shifts, raised awareness about social justice issues, and drove online traffic. </p>

		
		<p> The only middle schooler both kicked out of class for being <b> “too political” </b> and to dress up as a judge for Halloween (think: RBG before she was ‘hip’), she cares passionately about issues like criminal justice reform, the constitutional right to digital privacy, and a woman's right to choose. Professionally, she works to move criminal justice forward through her digital communications role at the District Attorney's office. </p>

		<p> When she isn't writing social media copy, she is listening to NPR, baking kick-ass homemade cinnamon rolls, and reading #toomany biographies. A Seattleite at heart, she still gets nostalgic during rain storms and enjoys a sharp cup of coffee. </p>
